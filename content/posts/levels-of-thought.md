Computers excel at routine tasks and are capable of performing these with great precision and speed. Indeed one can even argue that the more routine a task is, the more the _comparative_ advantage of a computer in performing this task, and so people have a _comparative_ advantage in more sophisticated tasks. Yet it would be a fallacy to conclude from this that people are better at high-level tasks than computers.

Indeed, the major waves in automation have come from computers being able to handle tasks at successively higher cognitive levels. This is masked to some extent by the ability of computers to substitute a higher level of cognition with raw power at a lower level - but this has its limitations. Indeed we shall illustrate that in the present era (starting with about 2008), computers have exhibited all forms of high-level cognition.

### Arithmetic and Logic

A pocket calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations. The most basic operations beyond these are simple _logic_ - such as behaviour based on some condition, and _loops_, where we for instance perform calculations on a range of numbers. Slightly these these, our calculations can involve lists of numbers, lists of lists and so on.

### Procedures and functions

At the next level, we can define _procedures_ and _functions_ where we encode a _general method_ for solving a _class of problems_. These can be applied to specific problems, which are specified as _arguments_. The arguments are themselves numbers, lists etc.

The earliest programming languages, such as Fortran and Cobol, essentially restricted users to programs at these levels, which were compiled to the appropriate machine code. While such programs made computations fast and precise, their capabilities were limited. Indeed to date nobody has written a compiler for Fortran in Fortran itself.
