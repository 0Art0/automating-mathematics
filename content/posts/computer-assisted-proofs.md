A rapidly growing area is _Computer Assisted Proofs_ of claims that are expressed in precise mathematical terms. These can include ordinary mathematical theorems,as well as claims that pieces of hardware or software, network protocols, and mechanical and hybrid systems meet their specifications. Computer assistance here means both assistance in _discovery_ of proofs as well as _checking correctness_. Indeed the two aspects are generally integrated in _interactive proof systems_, with computers filling in the details of proof outlines.
