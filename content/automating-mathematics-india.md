I have created a [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/automated-mathematics-india) meant for informal discussions among those interested in Automated Theorem Proving. This is aimed mainly at those in/from India, but everyone interested in the topic is of course welcome.

I will post links to future blog posts in the group, so please join in case you want to be alerted.
