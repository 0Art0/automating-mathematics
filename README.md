# Euclidean Geometry by high-peformance SMT solvers?
## Siddhartha Gadgil and Anand Rao Tadipatri

Famous results of Gödel, Turing, Church and others show that there is no algorithm that can take a mathematical statement as input and return a proof or disproof. Yet, by a result of Tarski, we do have such programs for statements in Euclidean geometry (more precisely first-order statements).

This repository contains the results of our attempts using `Z3` — a high-performance solver from Microsoft — to prove two theorems in Euclidean Geometry. 

An interactive notebook containing the relevant code can be launched by clicking the `Launch Binder` badge above.
The notebook is a companion to our [article](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/SMTGeom.pdf), which has more background.
